35,,feature,link,How many enter/exits are there for each GT dataset?,done,,,
1,,feature,,"Add 3D, segmentation (spheres placing), tracking",done,,,
2,,feature,,implement predict mode 'withGT',done,,,
3,,feature,,training on multiple acquisitions,done,,,
4,,feature,,"DET, SEG, TRA (from labeled images) The bipartite graph / binary relation formed is a _partial function_ from GT objects to Proposals. That is, it's a function from a subset of GT object to proposals. nodes in GT have degree zero or one. Nodes in Pro have any degree. Let's skip this part and only do point cloud / tracking evaluations. It makes more sense to just run the official binaries instead of recreating them for in-memory ndarrays.",skip,,,
5,,feature,,"pseudo DET & TRA (from tracking on point clouds, for speed.) We can form a bipartite on point clouds. We don't really need SEG. We don't offer real segmentations. We just need fast/useful Detection and Tracking scores. We already have fast Detection scores on point clouds via SNNM. We can extend this to tracking via `trackmeasure`.",done,,,
6,,feature,,"F1, precision, recall on SNN matching.",done,,,
7,,refac,,Can placing of labeled spheres share code with `createTarget()`,done,,,
8,,perf,,@jit for binary cost matrix for assignment pairs (this provides only small gains),done,,,
9,,feature,,Add special cases for each ISBI dataset. We did it by keeping a table of params indexed by dataset and reading it directly.,done,,,
10,,bug,,change the size of `outer_patch` to have max of inner_patch + border + divmod_padding,done,,,
11,,bug,,replace downsampling with avg pooling. ~~smooth images before downsampling.~~ this will reduce noise and make it easier to find edges. how does image scale affect learning?,done,,,
12,,feature,,PNG draw with tracking tails.,done,,,
13,,perf,,Speed up PNG saving. (#ERR png saving is only slow on falcon because of throughput to disk!),skip,,,
14,,refac,,Remove NetworkX Dependency,done,,,
15,,feature,,Division specific tracking score,done,,,
16,,bug,,Oversaturated glance patches,done,,,
31,,refac,,Move dataset specific params to CSV,done,,,
23,1,feature,link,Draw tracking tail on top of GT links,ish,,,
27,1,accuracy,link,Why does NN tracking fail on BF-C2DL-MuSC ?,done,,May 4,
34,1,feature,link,Allow cells to enter and exit through boundaries,,,,
20,,feature,link,Implement More Linking Methods,,,,
21,,feature,link,"Replace Gurobi with custom, tracking-specific search",,,,
22,,feature,link,Make a C lib or static linked lib that offers tracking methods that compete head-to-head with TrackMate,,,,
28,,feature,link,Simulate smooth warp fields to test velgrad tracker,,,,
