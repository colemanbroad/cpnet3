name,,Dataset folder name
,,
pool,train/pred,How much to (anisotropically) downscale the raw images? Use whole numbers because we pool over non-overlapping pixel groups.
sigma,train,The diagonal elements of the Gaussian covariance matrix for the kernel shape
subsample,train/pred,Take every nth image for training and prediction
,,
voxelsize,fixed - isbi,"size in micrometers. x,y,[z]"
sparse,fixed - isbi,is every object in each image fully annotated?
times 01,fixed - isbi,"start and end time tuple e.g. (0, 100)"
times 02,fixed - isbi,start and end time tuple
tname,fixed - isbi,how many digits in t name? e.g. 't000.tif' = 3 and 't0000.tif' = 4
ndim,fixed - isbi,2D or 3D?
